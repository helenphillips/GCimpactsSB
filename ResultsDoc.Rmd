     labels = taxa$gcd, cex=1)



```

For all of the analyses, I have been grouping micro-arthropods with meso-fauna, and all other macro-invertebrates as macro-fauna.

I have been including the 'All sizes' category, despite the low number. I have ensured that it is not the intercept level.




```{r data2, echo = FALSE}


table(allDat$driver, allDat$Body.Size)


table(allDat$driver, allDat$Measurement)


```
I have removed from the dataset any measurement unlabelled, or labelled as FunctionalRichness, GroupAbundance, simpson and Evennes. Leaving, Abundance, biomass, Shannon and Richness. However, the richness category include all types of richness, e.g., species richness, genus richness and taxa richness. 




# Modelling protocol

All models have (nearly) the same starting structure. I have an interaction between GCD(type) and Body Size. The random effects have the unique ID for each case, nested within the ID of the paper (as one paper can provide multiple cases), crossed with MeasurementType. As we would expect the effect of the same MeasurementType to be more similar across studies, than different MeasurementTypes within studies.

I then use a QM Test of Moderators to see if the interaction, and then the individual moderators are significant (p < 0.01) and remove them if not. 

All models are fitted with REML, which is better (apparently).


# Global Driver Model

In the main model, I started with a model that contained the interaction between driver and body size.

Body size was not significant in the interaction or as an additive effect only. So was removed from the model.


```{r mainModlod, include = FALSE}
mod.2 <- readRDS(file = "Models/MainMod.rds")

```

```{r mainModres}
summary(mod.2)
```

Intercept is Climate Change.

The Test of Moderators output shows that there is a significant difference between the subgroups.

### Calculating the I^2
```{r mainmodi}
# https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:i2_multilevel_multivariate
W <- diag(1/mod.2$vi)
X <- model.matrix(mod.2)
P <- W - W %*% X %*% solve(t(X) %*% W %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% W
100 * sum(mod.2$sigma2) / (sum(mod.2$sigma2) + (mod.2$k-mod.2$p)/sum(diag(P)))

```

86.53% of the total variance due to heterogeneity.

```{r mainmodi_split} 

100 * mod.2$sigma2 / (sum(mod.2$sigma2) + (mod.2$k-mod.2$p)/sum(diag(P)))

```


About 48.37% of the total variance is estimated to be due to between-cluster heterogeneity, 35.68% due to within-cluster heterogeneity and only 2.47% due to the crossed effects. The remaining 13.47% is sampling variance.




```{r mainModPlot, echo = FALSE}
test <-predict(mod.2, newmods=rbind(c(0,0,0,0,0),
  # climate with all different measurement types

                             ), addx=TRUE, digits=2) #

slabs <- c("Climate", "Fragmentation", "Invasives", "LUI", "Nutrient", "Pollution")
par(mar=c(3, 8, 1, 1))
forest(test$pred, sei=test$se, slab=slabs,  xlab="Effect Size", xlim=c(-.4,.7))


```



# Climate Change

Climate change model did not include the 'All Sizes' category, due to having too little data. 


```{r ClimateModload, include = FALSE}
climate.mod.5 <- readRDS(file = "Models/ClimateMod.rds")

```

```{r ClimateModres}
summary(climate.mod.5)
```

```{r climatemodRes, echo = FALSE}

climatedat <-predict(climate.mod.5, newmods=rbind(c(0,0,0),
                                    c(1,0,0),
                                    c(0,1,0),
                                    c(0,0,1)
), addx=TRUE, digits=2) #

slabs <- c("Gas", "Temperature",
           "Water Availability-Drought", "Water Availability-Flood")
par(mar=c(3, 8, 1, 1))
forest(climatedat$pred, sei=climatedat$se, slab=slabs,  xlab="Effect Size", xlim=c(-.4,.7))



```

What is interesting here is that it is only the lack of water that has an impact on soil
fauna. I am surprised by a lack of affect of temperature.

NB: Majority of the time, the temperature change is a temperature increase.


# Land Use Intensity

In the LUI model, the additive effect of body size remains. 

```{r luiModload, include = FALSE}
lui.mod.2 <- readRDS(file = "Models/LUIMod.rds")

```

```{r luiModres}

```

```{r luires, echo = FALSE}


luidat <-predict(lui.mod.2, newmods=rbind(c(0,0,0,0,0,0),  # intercept

par(mar=c(4, 8, 1, 1))
# xaxt = "n" again excludes the automatic x-axis

abline(v=0, lty =2)

legend(x = "bottomright", legend = c("Macro/Meso", "Meso"), col = c("black", "grey"), pch = 19)






```

The black dots shows the effect on the macrofauna only (mesofauna is not significantly different from macrofauna). The grey dots shows how the effect varies for micro-fauna, which are significantly different from Macro/meso fauna.

```


Take home messages: Most nutrient enrichments have no impact on biodiversity. Those that do (organic fertilisers, 
manure, and mulch) are all ones that can be considered to be soil amendments. i.e. they are 
changing the structure of the soil (as well as adding nutrients). (or the nutrients are slow release??)
So it is more the change in structure that is beneficial, rather than the resource addition.

All organisms benefit from this change in structure, regardless of size.

# Invasive Species



```{r invaModload, include = FALSE}
invas.mod.3 <- readRDS(file = "Models/invasiveMod.rds")
```


There were no significant variables in the model (GCD type and  body size could be removed). Left with an intercept only model.
Where we can see that there is no significant impact of invasive species on soil fauna.

This lines up with main model.

```{r invaModres}
summary(invas.mod.3)
```


As I haven't done the habitat fragmentation due to lack of data, I think I would also be tempted to not
look indepth at invasive species either.



# Pollution

For the pollution model, I only used data from Metals and Pesticides, these had the most equal spread of data across the body sizes and the measurement types. I then split up the source of the pollution, e.g., industrial, agricultural, urban. 


```{r pollModload, include = FALSE}
poll <- readRDS(file = "Models/pollutionDataFrame.rds")

poll.mod.1d <- readRDS(file = "Models/pollutionMod.rds")

```


```{r pollModres}
# the original GCD Type

table(poll$GCDTypeSource)

summary(poll.mod.1d)
```


As with the invasive species. There are no significant moderators. However, the intercept is significantly negative (unlike the invasive species model).

This lines up with the main model.

Highlights that of the pollutants we can test, they are as bad as each other. Discussion point will be that we need more data in order to test the effects across even more pollutant types.

However, this was only using data from pesticides and metals, where each is also split by the source of the pollution (e.g., industrial, mining, urban, other). So we would need more different pollutant types to fully understand the effect of the pollution on soil fauna, and whether it really doesn't matter what pollutant it is.


# GSBA

Seems a bit strange that body size does not have an effect in any of the models.

So, we can look at some of the taxonomic groups, to see if they have differing response. Acari, Collembola, Earthworms and Nematodes have the most data across the different global change drivers.

I created a model, same structure as previous, with an interaction between the drivers and taxa group, with the additive effect of measurement type.


```{r gsbamod, include=FALSE}

mod.gsba.taxa <- readRDS(file = "Models/GSBAMod.rds")

```

```{r gsbamod2, echo = FALSE}

summary(mod.gsba.taxa)
```

We can plot just the changes, and because habitat fragmentation and invasive species have the least amount of data (and thus, the interaction is poorly represented), we can also exclude them from the plot.

```{r gsbamodplot, echo = FALSE}

t_dat <-predict(mod.gsba.taxa, newmods=rbind(c(0,0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0),

                   addx=TRUE, digits=2) #

gcds <- rep(c("Climate", "habitat", "invasives", "lui", "nutrient", "pollution"), each = 4)
taxa <- rep(c("acari","collembola", "earthworms", "nematodes"), times = 6)

slabs <- paste(gcds, taxa)

# exclude habitat frag and invasives (little data)
subs <- c(1:4, 13:24)

par(mar=c(3, 8, 1, 1))
forest(t_dat$pred[subs], sei=t_dat$se[subs], slab=slabs[subs],  xlab="Effect Size", xlim=c(-.4,.7))


```


It shows that for Climate Change, LUI and pollution, all the taxa groups are responding the same way and quite similarly. Which indicates that that is why body size isn't important.
For Nutrient Enrichment, we can see that earthworms respond very positively, and the other groups do not significantly respond at all.



I did also do a model using the GSBA groups (e.g., ground-dwelling macrofauna, etc), as an additive effect to the GCD (as there was not enough data for an interaction) and the GSBa group was not significant.



## System Type

To check that the system that the data came from (e.g., woody, dry/cold, grassland, agricultural) didn't have an impact on the results, I ran another model with System interacting with GCD. System Type was able to be removed from the model completely.


## Change over time


```{r overtime, echo=FALSE}

meta$year <- sapply(strsplit(meta$NameOfPDF,'_'), "[", 2)

hedges <- merge(allDat, meta[,c('ID', 'year')], by = "ID", all.x = TRUE)

# No significant effect
summary(lm(effect ~ as.integer(year), data = hedges))

plot(y = hedges$effect, x = hedges$year, ylim = c(-3, 3))

```

There seems to be no effect of publication year on the effect size.

## Publication bias

```{r pubbias}
funnel(mod.2, main="Standard Error")

## Trying to remove some of the outliers from the plot
funnel(mod.2, main="Standard Error", ylim = c(5, 0), xlim = c(-40,40))


funnel(mod.2, yaxis="vi", main="Sampling Variance")
funnel(mod.2, yaxis="seinv", main="Inverse Standard Error")
funnel(mod.2, yaxis="vinv", main="Inverse Sampling Variance")

```

That looks pretty bad. It is hard to see, but if you try and exclude the worst of the outliers, 
the points that are left, are still not great, but are more in the funnel than you would led to believe at this scale.

What about looking at the bias within each GCD.

```{r pubbias1}
funnel(climate.mod.5,  main = "Climate change")

funnel(climate.mod.5,  main = "Climate change", ylim = c(5, 0), xlim = c(-25, 25))



funnel(lui.mod.2,  main = "Land use intensity")
funnel(nutri.mod.2, main = "Nutrient enrichment")
funnel(invas.mod.3,  main = "Invasion")
funnel(poll.mod.1d,  main = "Pollution")


```

All of them are somewhat bad, having outliers that make everything look worse than it really is.

Climate change has the most obviously outliers. Pollution has the most consistent/gradient of outliers.
Need to look through the outliers and double check that they are not typos etc.

The meta-analysis hand book suggests an eggers Regression test to determine whether there is asymmetry in the publications.

This page: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/155693/metafor-package-bias-and-sensitivity-diagnostics gave information on how to do this with a more complex model.

In this model, 'mods' is the variance of the effect size.


```{r eggers}
test.egger <- readRDS(file = "Models/Eggersmod.rds")

summary(test.egger)

```

So there is asymmetry in the publications.

The next chunk uses the code that Lea sent to produce a similar Egger's analysis. 
I am not entirely sure what it means yet. But think it shows similar to the funnel plot, 
in that all GCDs are an issue, except the invasives.



```{r biasfromLEa}

eggereg <- readRDS(file = "Models/Eggersmod_lea.rds")

summary(eggereg)
```

So ultimately, we are missing the studies that have low precisions (low power, low sample size) and larger effect sizes. We have a lot of studies with high precision and a variety of effect sizes.

We also have a lot of outliers, that show big effect sizes and low preicision. A lot of these are in pollution and climate change.

There is also probably something to say, that the largest outliers are negative effect sizes.....

```{r differingGCDs}

climate_eggerreg <- readRDS("Models/ClimateEggersmod_lea.rds")
summary(climate_eggerreg)

lui_eggerreg <- readRDS("Models/LUIEggersmod_lea.rds")
summary(lui_eggerreg)

nutri_eggerreg <- readRDS("Models/NutriEggersmod_lea.rds")
summary(nutri_eggerreg)

invas_eggerreg <- readRDS("Models/InvasEggersmod_lea.rds")
summary(invas_eggerreg)

poll_eggerreg <- readRDS("Models/PollEggersmod_lea.rds")
summary(poll_eggerreg)


```
